# IMPULSE-copy

This is a practice to learn how to use React JS. This is for **practice only**, meaning that this repo is **NOT** associated with the original IMPULSE website nor with the university itself. Huge thanks to [Dita](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8MGAa_nbpT/) for providing the design. If you have any comments or suggestions, please don't hesitate to write them in the issues tab. Thank you!

p.s.: the one thing that bugs me alot about the original website is that the acronym is not actually a correct form of acronym.
